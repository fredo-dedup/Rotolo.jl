# ideas :
- catch writemime calls, as if in debugging mode ? and use Signals...
- lookup watch_io in stdio.jl
- Traits pour capter appels Ã  writemime ?

# new func :
- add : force browser focus on bottom of current
- add : command to switch to another session
- add : tree struct for chunks, referenced like a file struct

# issues :
- check if server already running, if yes reset
- multiple evaluation returning only last value
- pyplot showing multiple times, sometimes impossible to remove but with a F5
- widget signal not caught
- all text output caught and not shown

# DONE :
- add : Matplotlib Tiles - OK
- add : commands to load Escher assets - OK
